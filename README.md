# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction---Analyse
Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are the state-of-the-art algorithm for sequential data and are used by Apple's Siri and Google's voice search. It is an algorithm that remembers its input due to its internal memory, which makes the algorithm perfectly suited for solving machine learning problems involving sequential data. It is one of the algorithms that has great results in deep learning. In this article it is discussed how to predict the price of Bitcoin by analyzing the information of the last 6 years.  We implemented a simple model that helps us better understand how time series works using Python and RNNs.
